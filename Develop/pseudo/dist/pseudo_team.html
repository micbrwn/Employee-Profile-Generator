    <!-- The construct of html elements for employees is to have a row wrap around employee card elements.
        The card element for each element should be the same except for the content values. For examples:
        their names, their roles, their IDs, their emails. In addtion, based on diff employee types, a manager
        has office number; an engineer has github name; an intern has school name. -->
    <!-- Again, the construct of all employee card elements should be the same. As such they can be constructed
        in javascript using template literals with variables to be replaced based on the user input for their
        names, emails, etc. -->
